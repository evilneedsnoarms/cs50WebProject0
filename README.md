Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is a guess the picture game using bootstrap grids and css styling links. It has an index page that links to 3 other pages with a game each. The index page has a table and explanation of use. Each of the three pages has a navbar using unordered lists to link between the other three. Issues with smallest screen sizes.
