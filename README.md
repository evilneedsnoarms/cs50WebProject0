# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is a guess the picture game using bootstrap grids and css styling links.
It has an index page that links to 3 other pages with a game each.
The index page has a table and explanation of use. 
Each of the three game pages has a navbar using an unordered list of icons to link between the other three.
Each game uses animation delay of color changes to slowly display a picture.
The picture resets if the correct word is entered into the form (submit refreshing the page)
Issues with smallest screen sizes.
Am aware this could be done far more elegantly dynamically and the use of form is unorthodox.
